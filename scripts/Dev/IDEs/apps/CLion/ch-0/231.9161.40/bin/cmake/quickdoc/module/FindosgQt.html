<p>This is part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph
components.  Each component is separate and you must opt in to each
module.  You must also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer
if needed) as these modules won't do it for you.  This is to allow you
control over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt
out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular
module (perhaps because the default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't
work with your system as an example).  If you want to use a more
convenient module that includes everything, use the
FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.</p>
<p>Locate osgQt This module defines</p>
<p>OSGQT_FOUND - Was osgQt found? OSGQT_INCLUDE_DIR - Where to find the
headers OSGQT_LIBRARIES - The libraries to link for osgQt (use this)</p>
<p>OSGQT_LIBRARY - The osgQt library OSGQT_LIBRARY_DEBUG - The osgQt
debug library</p>
<p>$OSGDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$OSGDIR used in building osg.</p>
