<h1>bugprone-macro-parentheses</h1>
<p>Finds macros that can have unexpected behavior due to missing parentheses.</p>
<p>Macros are expanded by the preprocessor as-is. As a result, there can be
unexpected behavior; operators may be evaluated in unexpected order and
unary operators may become binary operators, etc.</p>
<p>When the replacement list has an expression, it is recommended to surround
it with parentheses. This ensures that the macro result is evaluated
completely before it is used.</p>
<p>It is also recommended to surround macro arguments in the replacement list
with parentheses. This ensures that the argument value is calculated
properly.</p>
