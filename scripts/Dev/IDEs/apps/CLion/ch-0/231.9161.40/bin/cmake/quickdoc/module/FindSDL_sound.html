<span id="module:FindSDL_sound"><!--f--></span><h1>FindSDL_sound</h1>
<p>Locates the SDL_sound library</p>
<p>This module depends on SDL being found and must be called AFTER
FindSDL.cmake is called.</p>
<p>This module defines</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>SDL_SOUND_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL_sound.h
SDL_SOUND_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL_sound
SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES, this contains the list of libraries that you need
  to link against.
SDL_SOUND_EXTRAS, this is an optional variable for you to add your own
  flags to SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES. This is prepended to SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES.
  This is available mostly for cases this module failed to anticipate for
  and you must add additional flags. This is marked as ADVANCED.
SDL_SOUND_VERSION_STRING, human-readable string containing the
  version of SDL_sound
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This module also defines (but you shouldn't need to use directly)</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY, the name of just the SDL_sound library you would link
against. Use SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES for you link instructions and not this one.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And might define the following as needed</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>MIKMOD_LIBRARY
MODPLUG_LIBRARY
OGG_LIBRARY
VORBIS_LIBRARY
SMPEG_LIBRARY
FLAC_LIBRARY
SPEEX_LIBRARY
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Typically, you should not use these variables directly, and you should
use SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES which contains SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY and the other
audio libraries (if needed) to successfully compile on your system.</p>
<p>Responds to the $SDLDIR and $SDLSOUNDDIR environmental variable that
would correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building
SDL.</p>
<p>On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
People will have to manually change the cache values of SDL_LIBRARY to
override this selectionor set the CMake environment CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
to modify the search paths.</p>
