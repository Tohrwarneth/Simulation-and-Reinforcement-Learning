<p>OpenThreads is a C++ based threading library.  Its largest userbase
seems to OpenSceneGraph so you might notice I accept OSGDIR as an
environment path.  I consider this part of the Findosg* suite used to
find OpenSceneGraph components.  Each component is separate and you
must opt in to each module.</p>
<p>Locate OpenThreads This module defines OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY
OPENTHREADS_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to OpenThreads
OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers</p>
<p>$OPENTHREADS_DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to
the ./configure --prefix=$OPENTHREADS_DIR used in building osg.</p>
<p>[CMake 2.8.10]: The CMake variables OPENTHREADS_DIR or OSG_DIR can now
be used as well to influence detection, instead of needing to specify
an environment variable.</p>
